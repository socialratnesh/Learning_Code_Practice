In this tutorial Jason talks about use of double underscore in identifier name.

Use of two sequential underscore characters ( __ ) in an identifier, or a single leading underscore followed by a capital letter, is reserved for C++ implementations in all scopes. You should avoid using one leading underscore followed by a lowercase letter for names with file scope because of possible conflicts with current or future reserved identifiers.
