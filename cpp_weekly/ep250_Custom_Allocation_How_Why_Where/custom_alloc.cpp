    This example demonstrates about PMR Custom Allocation

    Adavantages of custom allocation:
    -> Fewer calls to new and delete
    -> Reduced thread contention
    -> Reduced false sharing
    -> Reduced memory diffusion
        (aka increased memory contiguity)
    -> The ability to "wink out" memory in GC sense
